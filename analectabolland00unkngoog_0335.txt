03. nat is trewc, yf it plcasc your Gracc (quotti my lord of Canter-
bury), and 1 doubt not but my brothorcn here wal ocknowlcdyc the
same.

Then my lord of Rochester, knowinge the cleernes of his owne
conscience and perceiving the dooble dealinge in this matter, was
forced for discharge of his owne credit and truth to breake a litle
square, and said to my lord of Canterbury: No, my lor-dc, not soe;
under your favour, all the bishops were not so farre ayrccd, for to that
instrument ⁵ you have nothm- my hand nor scale.

- N o, ah l (quoth the kinge); and therwith (looking upon ¹ my lord
of Rochester with a frowninge countenance) said : Is not this your
hand and your scale ἓ And shewed him the instrument with scales.

—- No, forsooth (quoth the bishop).

— How say you to that ἓ said the kinge to my lord of Canterbury.

— S* (said he), itis his hand and his scale.

— No, my corde (quoth the bishop of Rochester againe), in deod you
wore o en in hand with mc for my hand and my scale, as other of my
lov-des have donc ,· but then I ever said to you, [would in noe wisc con-
sent to any such acte, for yt was muchs ayainst my conscience to have
this matter so much as once called in question .- and thensoro my hand
and scale should never he put to any such instrument, God willinqc,
with more communicacion between usin that busines, yf you rcmcmber.

probe novisset, et aliorum episcoporum fraudes ac simulatas artes
perspexisset, ad famam fidemque suam purgandam cogebatur ab eo
nonnihil dissentire. Negavit enim omnes episcopos ita ut dictum
erat, consensisse, quia his litteris, inquit, eqo non subscripsi.

Quem rex torvo vultu aspiciens: Minime, inquit, consensisti? quasi
vero tua manus ct scriptura, tuumque siyillum, quod vides, non sit.

Quod cum ille constanter pernegaret, percontatus rex ab archiepi-
scopo cantuariensi, si illa scriptura et sigillum Roffensis non essent.
1110 autem affirmante, Roffensis e contra replicabat; archiepiscopum
apud se egisse saepenumero ut cum reliquis subscriberet et con-
signaret, se vero semper respondisse, contra conscientiam suam esse,
