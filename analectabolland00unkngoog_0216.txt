St John of Beverley‚ archbishop ot' Yorke, lived and preached. In
his baptisme he was named John ot’ his godfathers 3 which name he

in good estimacion and credit, dyed‚ leavinge behind him this John
Fysher (of whom we now speake) (2) and Robert, both in their tender

tudine in rudimentis grammatices apud quendam sacerdotem eccle·
