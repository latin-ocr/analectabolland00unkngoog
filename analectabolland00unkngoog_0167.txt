[f. 262⁹] Yt was reported unto me by Mt Truslow, who was
both his chaplen and his steward, yt- at the tyme of his
apprehension he had not remaynynge of redy· money in ‚all
the world much above mli, which money was taken from
him.

XIX. (wo-1) The mornynge y? he should die, Mt Wal-
singham the leutenant came to him being in bedd within his
close prison [eJarly in the mornynge betwene 4 and 5 of
th[e] [f. 263r10100ke. And said to him γ* the writt was cum
for th[e] execution to be done the same day before x of the
cl[0cke]. Whome he thanked and with a mery countenance
receyved [his] message‚ saienge: Let me rest a while and I will
malae me redy. And after risinge‚ he put on all the best
apparel] he had, trussed his hose round, buttoned his cote,
and caused him self to be as curiously wraid in all points a's
he could devise. And when his servant said: My Lord,
I marvell you are so carious in 'trymynye your sels, seynqe you
shall putt of all ayayne ere it be none, he answered agayne ε
What, man, dost not thow knowe y‘ this is our weddiny day ἓ
Ι must be yay this day for honor of the maffiaqe.

XX. (183) When the leutenant had brought him downe
out of h[is] prison at lx of the clocke, and staid at the
bu1w[ark] [f. 263*] to know in what redynes the sherifs of
London were, he leanyng him sels to a stone of the wall,
opened his booke of the new testament which he caried in
his hand, and said: 012, Lora, this is the last tymc y‘ ever
I shall looke in this booke. Let sum comfortable place chance
unto me. And openynge his hook at aventure, the first sen-
tence y* came to his eye was this ε Haec est autem vita aeterna
ut coqnoscant te solum verum Deum, et quem misisti I hesum
Christum. Which sentence when 116 had redd, he clapped to
the booke3 and thankinge God‚ said: Hah-q] is even ynouqh.
I nede no more learnynqe to my lyfes end. And still to ·the
skaffold he was saienge and meditatinge of this sentence.
