After my humble oommendations for aunswere unto your letters
dated at [london]‚ December 8, maye it please yowe to understand,
that the sermons mentioned in the former letters, be the vel-aye
same that γον wright of. ’

As towehyng my late Lorde of Canterburie’ 8 110οὶ8, 88111 unto Benet
college, truth it 18 that there eam downe somewhat after 11181181-
11188, 88 Ῑ take yt, oertayne vessels with hookes‚ which yet remayne
unbroken up at the cariers. But what ist the cause I knowe not.

As towching the schedule which was inclosed ,γον have apoynted
unto me one of Hercules 1811018, 8811. Augii ⁸⁸² stabulum. For 01118888
γον seur and showe me what ν8γ8 to take to accomplishe but some
litle parte of your ..... 1 8811 1101 of my selve invente 11ον to begynne
(01· 10 goe forward). For ...... 88 sunt tempora et multorum hominum
ingenia subdola et nimis suspiciosa. [And] what should a man
fere that when with us there is fewe [old] grandsie[rs 1)] care or do
remembre anye suche matter. That that 1 thought.... to do, 1 have
taken in hande and made thereof‘my Christemas pastime, imploying
all the dayes and my tyme 1ο serehe owt somewhat to satisfle some
parte of your desyer. But the more Ihave travelyd‚ I am the more
inelosed with the labyrinthe. Ffor 1 find many persons of like 11811188,
but their surnames by the iniquitie of the tyme be not speeifled.
Therfor for certaynetye 1 f [eare] 1 shall 88γ8 nothyng. 1 have pemsed
the universitie eowehers ab ano 1501 what tyme Dr. Fissher was
vieechauncelor unto 1542. And what 1 have founde, γον 811811 per·
eeave. Peradventure yf the religiouse before their entryng into
religion were seculer, and as seculers toke degree, moe may and
might be founde owt. But Ι have principallye setled upon the reli-
310888, for that the other were almost infinite.

Ι fynde therefore one Reynold 1ο 118 1188111181· of arte 1501, and
M. A. 15033 and he was of St. Austeins hostell. An other Reynold
bach. of Arte 1505, and M. A. 1509. And 811 011181· to 118 Β. A. 1510.
But Ricardus Reynold was B. D. and allowed a preacher under the
universitie 88818 1513, as γον 811811 pert-„eave 11γ 1118 grace recorded
in our bokys, which foloweth de verbu, 818.

‘¹ Conceditur 1513 Ricardo Reynold ut responsio et formahabita

- sufficiat sihi pro gradu bach. in theologia, ita quod eius admissio

stet pro pleno gradu eiusdem, quia intendit breviter intrare religio-
nem, 818 quod admittatur ante festum Barnabae, non obstante statute,
