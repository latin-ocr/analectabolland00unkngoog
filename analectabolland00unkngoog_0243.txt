a gratinus medicin‚ sought meanes to cure as many therwith as he
coulde that as well studente ot· the universitie as others there might
have their partes of that heavenly tren-sure.

28. Wherfore he eommaunded that, cei-taine copies of the said nn·
dulgenccs (which then were in priate) should be sett up in sundrie
puhlique places ot· the universitic, wherof one was fixed on the
schoolegate. Now were there at that timein Cambrige some ot' lyke
ill spirit 'as Luther was in Saxonie, though they were verie secreat
and in number verie terve, who, as far as they durst, went about to
deprave the authoritie therof. Among whom a certaine wretched
and * pernitious person, at that time in the univer-sitio, envying thc
spirituall profltt ot* others, reading on a day the foresaid indulgent-,es
upon the schoolcgate‚ began straight way, by instigacion of some· ill
spirit,·to excogitate and thinke how he might both slaunder the
authoritie of the· Pope and hindei· γὸ benefit ot* the pardon in the
hartcs of good people. thrupon secretly in the night comminge to
the schoolegate, where the pardon stood, he wrote upon yt these
wordes z Beatus vir cuius est nomen Domini spes eius, et non respexit

. pennatam ,fresoniae falsas (im-ss), wrestinge therby the senee of that

‚place ot* holy scripture from the trew meaninge‚ by addinge to the
,text ‘this ‚word isus, othis owne malicious invention and devise. In
the morninge the schooles* being set open and schollers of all sorts
resortinge thither accordinge to their wonted manner, many beheld

this strange spectacle3 and as the good catholicks were much offended

posteaquam in omnes regni partes dimigatam vidit, ibi quoque
eandem promulgari et plerisque m locis valvis affigi iussit.

28. Cuius cum certum quoddam exemplar in portis scholarum
publicarum positum esset, statim ut quidam diabolico et haeretico
spiritu correptus in iilud incidisset (erant enim tum quidam lupi
lutherani qui sub ovina pelle m ea universitate latuerunt), coepit diu
multumque apud se cogitare, quomodo pontificiae auctoritati detra·
here et huius indulgentiae fructum impedite posset. Nocte igitur ad
scholarum portas ciam accedens, haec verba litteris pontificiis in
margine inseruit zBeatus vir cuias est nomen Domini spes eius, et non
respexit in vanitates et insanias falsas isus. Quibus verbis non solum
scripturae sacrae contextum a proprio et genuino sensu in alienum
et plane impium detorquere, sed et voculam hanc mss de suo addere
ausus est. Sequenti mane curn ad has scholas omnium ordinum et
professionum audItores confluerent, boni et catholici, lecta hac
sententia, contentam manifestam impietatem aestuare et tumultuari
