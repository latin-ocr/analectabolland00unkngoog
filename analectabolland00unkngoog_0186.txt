[10]. whether you remember any ottho munke ottho char-
terhowse [at the] nniversyty 111 your tyme 01· 110, end what
there names were ⁴? One [was] Master Rochester, brother as I tak
yt to queene Maryes contsoll[er] (1).

Item N udycate was an other, sumtyme a fyne 001111001- 12), and
for..... movyd to fol-sake that lyff, he professyd hymself a m0[nk in]
that order. And Master Rochester waytyng on a Master with h[im] at
a bankett 01· dynner was furst callyd (as he said) [to forsake] that
lyss, and to goe into relygyon andm.. professyd hymself a monke of
the sayd order. Whan [he was in the monastic]all lyff, he lyvyd verye
vertuusly one of the ..................
[f. 277v] of the (thurch, to whom the duke shold saye after thys
manner ε Hany'e lmave, hanye knave, με wa[⁸] better that X man such
as thow art war hanqyd than that shold cum to passe. Ther is
noe dowte but the kynq shull have yssewe males, to put that question
owt of dowte.

I thynk yow have hard as wellas 1 that father Raynolds and the
other of hys felowes of the Charterhowse, the daye as 1 [remember]
that the Kynges offyeers shold cum 10 dyssolve 1110 hewse, he as
1 thynk or sum of the other beynge at masse, and abowte the Agnae,
aswell he as thos that war present [a]s also they that war absent,
had suche a ioyfuIl cumfortable visyon, as they war ravisshyd with
a marvelus hevenlye ioye, so that he that was at masse stayed a
eerten tyme, the water runnynge down by his cheks for ioye. Than
aster mae, they knelinge afore the awlter in ther devowte prayoum,
laying all the keys of 11101· howse uppon the awlter‚- ffor that they
wold not delyver them to the kyngs offycerS.

As Ι 10111οω1101, 1110 sayd Father Raynolds was one of the ¹v that
was executyd whan the sayd Rochester and N udicate sufferyd.Which
Raynolds beyng the last, ‘that was executyd‚ and seyng them cruelly
quarteryd, and 11101· howells taken owt, preachyd unto them and
cumfortyd them, promysyng them a hevenlye bankett and supper,
for ther sharpe br[reak]fast taken pacyentlye for ther Master sake3
never changyd eolur or dysquyetyd. And then in the end lastelye
went 10 [die] manfully hymself.

Le reste de la paqe est vide.
