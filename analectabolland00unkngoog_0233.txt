without the helpe ot' any chaplem not in such speed or hastis man-
nerto he at an ende as many will doe, but in most revereat and
devout manner, so distinctly and treatibly pronouncing every word,
that he seemed a verie devowrer of heavenly foede, never satiate
nor filled ther-with. In so much as talking on a time πώ a carthusian
monke, who much commended his zeal and dilligent paines in eom·
piling his hooke against Luther, he answered againe sayinsse γ*
he wished that time of wrytinge had henne spent in praier, thinking
that prayr would have done more good and was of more merritt.
And to helpe this his devotion, he caused a great hole to be diffled
through the wall of his church θ of Rochester, wherby he might the
more commodiously have prospect into the chureh at masse and
evensougetimes.

20. When he himself should say masse, as many times he used to
doe, γὲ· he were not letted by some urgent and great cause, γε might
then perceive in him such ernest devotion, that many times the
teares would fall from his cheekes. And lest that the memorie of
death might hap to slip from his minde, he alwais accustomed to set
upon one ende ot· the altar a dead mans scull (1), which was also set

before him at his table as he dyned or supped, and in all his

praescriptis horis intermisit, sed debitum horarum canonicarum pen·
sum non, ut quidam solent, omnino perfunctorie et frigide, sed
attente, distincte et devote solus ipse secum exsolvit. Quin etiam ora-

tionis hac suavitate atque gustu ita delectatus suit, ut aliquot egregios
libellos de orando Deum composuerit, et cuidam carthusiano piam hanc

diligentiam eius in libris contra haereticos edendis multum lau·

hendo collocaverat, in orando consumpsisset, plus enim inde utili-
tatis ad extirpandas has haereses, divina gratia opitulante, sperari
potuisse. Sed et murum inter domum episcopalem et ecclesiam inter·
iectum perforavit, ut inde, cum sacrum celebraretur, quoties vellet in
templum prospiceret.

20. Cum veroipse rem divinam faceret, saepe visae sunt ex eius
genis lacrimae distillare, nomenque Iesu lam in precibus fundendis
quam in sermone familiari peculiari quadam reverentia coluit. Ac ne
umquam animo suo memoria mortis quae ent remedium peccati exce·
deret, ubique tam in altari in quo celebrabat quam domi suae
