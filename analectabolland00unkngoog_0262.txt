Oxford, her sister, the >other universitie, was miserably tossed end
turmoyled with the pesteferous heresies and sectes ot Wicklefe(1). For
we may reads of divers learned clerks, mmtimes schollers and stu·

dients of this univer-sitis ot Cambrisse, that have in their sever-all

times learnedly conmted end most ceremur rootsd out such perni- -

tious heresies, as then were dispersed as well in this realme as
elswhere.

42 And even now in these our daies there have not wanted sundrie
learned fathers of that number, besides this most reverend and holy
doctor ot whom we now intreate, that have· stept forth against these
damnable errors and sectes now troublinss this realme and the
whole world besides. By whose leaminss end dilligence it is- not
unlyke but the realm might have bene safely preserved, had not the
kiug himself henne first infected with this fowle and ¹ horrible
spott of heresie,* who by his owne unlawmll powre not only removed
from their places all those auncient and sace rulers, tliat should by
their learninge and grave authoritie have repulsed such pernitious
sects, but also placed in their roome‘s such and so many hereticks ns
himself had chosen to set forward his wicked and execrable
purposes ’-

[And as it is not to be read of any hereticke by them brought forth
ot their owne ssocke and number, so have they not willingly suffred

scilicet, Wiclefl haeresibus misere ‚iactata fuisset, multos ex hac
Universitate prodiisse scimus· qui errores illius doctissime confu-
terunt.

42. Neque hac nostra aetate defuerunt (quorum de numero iste de
quo nunc loquimur erat facile princeps) qui per totum orbem gras-
santes tot errorum pestes multis et magnis voluminibus consciderint.
