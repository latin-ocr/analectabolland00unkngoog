1 19. The kings counsellors to that replyed and said that the king
had no such meaninge as he doubted and there alledged againe his
royall protestacion and oath made in the word ofa kinge. And further
(said they) thouyh the supremaet‘e were yraunted to his Maiestie simply
and absolutely according! to his demaund, yet it must nudes be under-
standed and taken that he can have no fur-0201· power or author-iiie by
yt then omn-run rsa naen Du metr. And then yf a temper-all prince
can have no such authoritie and power by Gods lawe (as his lordsha’pp
had there deelared), what needeth the forecastinq of au these doubtes ἓ
Then at last the counsellors fell into disputacion amonge the bishopps
of a temperall princes authoritie over the clergie3 but therunto my
lord of Rochester answered them so fully that they bad not lyst to
deale that waie any further. For they were in deede but 'simple
smatterers in divinitie to speake before such a divine as he was. And
so they departed in '⁸‘ great anger, shewing themselves openly in

their owne lykenes and saying that, whosoever would refuso to eondi-

119. Ad quae omnia consiliarii regii responderunt nihil umquam
tale regem somniasse, sicuti et ipse sacrosancte proprio iuramento
palam protestatus est. Sed finqamus, inquiunt illi, absolute et simpli-
citer Ecclesiae anylicanae primatum ills· fuisse concessum, eum hae ta-
men moderatione intelleyi debet ut non plus sibi ex eo potestatis vindicare
possit, quam ipsi per Dei leqem liceat. Quod si rex terrenus nullam
potestatem spiritualem iure divino habere poterit, ut iam episcopus
Roffensis exposuit, quorsum opus est tam multas difficultates inicere?
Sed curn iidem postea inciperent de anctoritate principis saecularis in
clerum disputare, Roffensis omnibus eorum obiectionibus tam abunde
satisfecit utnon liberet eis amplius de huiusmodi rebus verba facere.
Erant enimin rebus theologicis nimis ieiuni 'ut coram tanto theologo
in disputatione consisterent. Ex quo colloquio tanta ira et furore
commoti recesserunt ut assererent eum pro fideli cive ac subdito
nequaquam·habendum fore, qui hoc postulatum in regis sui gratiam
non libenter concederet.
